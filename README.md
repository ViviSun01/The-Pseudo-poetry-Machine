# The-Pseudo-poetry-Machine
A machine-learning project that extracts and cleans poems from the Chinese-Poetry dataset in Google Colab, classifies each line using SnowNLP sentiment analysis, and outputs scored “pseudo-poems.” The data is then visualized in a p5.js webpage where users can input a value to display a random poem.

You can view and run the full data-processing workflow (dataset extraction, cleaning, and SnowNLP sentiment scoring) in the following Colab notebook:
